# ∞ Infinity ID

### Secure-by-design identity & access management — in Rust.

**OpenID Connect · OAuth 2.0 · TOTP MFA · RBAC · Edge Gateway · Admin Dashboard**

A fast, single-binary, self-hostable alternative to **Auth0, Okta, OneLogin and Clerk** — without the "SSO tax," per-MAU billing, or feature gates on essential security.

## Why Infinity ID

Identity providers gate the security features you actually need — SAML, RBAC, impersonation, audit — behind expensive enterprise contracts, then bill you per monthly active user. Infinity ID takes the opposite stance:

- **Every security feature is in the box.** MFA, RBAC, refresh-token rotation, audit logging, rate limiting — no paywall.
- **One fast binary.** Written in Rust: no GC pauses, predictable tail latency, a tiny memory footprint, and memory safety by construction.
- **Runs anywhere.** SQLite by default — `cargo run` and you have a working IdP. Ships with Docker + Compose for cloud.
- **Secure by design.** Argon2id, RS256/JWKS, PKCE-enforced flows, and a hardened threat model (see [Security](#-security)).

> **Positioning:** Infinity ID is the flagship of the [**Infinity Stack**](../README.md) — a family of Rust-native replacements for over-monetized SaaS infrastructure.

## 📸 The dashboard

A modern, dark-theme admin console is **embedded in the binary** (no Node build, no separate frontend to deploy).

## ✨ Features

### Standards-based auth
- **OpenID Connect** discovery (`/.well-known/openid-configuration`) + **JWKS** (`/.well-known/jwks.json`)
- **OAuth 2.0 grants:** Authorization Code **+ PKCE (S256)**, Client Credentials, Refresh Token, and Resource-Owner Password (first-party CLI)
- **RS256** access & ID tokens signed with a persisted RSA key; validate anywhere with the public JWKS
- **`/userinfo`** endpoint

### Multi-factor authentication
- **TOTP (RFC 6238)** compatible with Google Authenticator, 1Password, Authy, etc.
- **Single-use recovery codes** (stored only as hashes)
- Self-service enrolment / activation / disable

### Access control
- **RBAC** with `resource:action` permissions and `*` wildcards (`users:*`, `*:*`)
- Built-in `superadmin` / `admin` / `user` roles, fully editable
- Privilege-escalation guards (an admin can't grant itself `superadmin`)

### Operations
- **Immutable audit log** of security events (logins, token issuance, admin changes)
- **Brute-force protection** (per-account lockout) + **global per-IP rate limiting**
- Structured tracing, CORS, and hardened HTTP security headers
- **Infinity Edge** — an auth-aware reverse proxy that validates tokens at the edge

## 🔒 Security

Infinity ID is built to withstand scrutiny from a security professional. Highlights:

| Area | Hardening |
|---|---|
| **Password storage** | Argon2id (memory-hard, OWASP params: 19 MiB, 2 passes) |
| **Token signing** | RS256 with persisted key; public JWKS; algorithm pinned on validation (no `alg=none`/HS confusion) |
| **PKCE** | Required for public clients; **only S256 accepted** (`plain` refused) |
| **Client auth** | Confidential clients authenticated with **constant-time** secret comparison at the token endpoint **and on refresh** (RFC 6749 §6) |
| **Auth codes** | Single-use (atomic `DELETE … RETURNING`, no redemption race), short-TTL, `redirect_uri` exact-match, bound to `client_id` |
| **Refresh tokens** | Rotated on use; **reuse detection revokes the whole token family**; confidential-client secret required to redeem |
| **MFA (TOTP)** | RFC 6238; codes are **one-time-use** — an accepted time-step is recorded and older/replayed codes are rejected within the skew window; recovery codes are single-use |
| **Scopes** | Requested scopes are **narrowed to the client's registration** — no self-asserted privileged scopes |
| **Token audience** | Management API requires a **first-party** token (audience = issuer) — third-party RP tokens can't be replayed against `/admin/*`. The edge can pin a per-route `audience` so a token minted for another client is rejected |
| **Token type** | `id_token`s are rejected wherever an access token is expected (server **and** edge) |
| **Sessions** | Opaque, hashed at rest, `HttpOnly` + `SameSite=Strict` (+ `Secure` by default off loopback), **server-side revocation on logout** |
| **Brute force** | Per-account lockout + global per-IP rate limit (Argon2 makes floods expensive, so this matters) |
| **User enumeration** | Uniform errors + timing equalization; disabled-account status is only checked **after** password verification |
| **Transport hardening** | CSP, HSTS, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy` |
| **Error handling** | Internal/DB errors are logged server-side and returned to clients as generic messages |
| **Edge** | Validates token audience; matches `required_scope` against scopes and `required_role` against roles **separately** (roles never satisfy a scope check); strips client-supplied identity headers and injects a verified `X-Infinity-Sub` |
| **First run** | If no admin password is provided, a strong random one is generated and shown once in the logs |

> This codebase passed two rounds of automated security review. Findings from the first round (scope self-assertion, audience confusion, role-escalation, edge token-type) and the second (TOTP code replay, refresh-token client authentication, auth-code redemption race, edge audience/role–scope separation) were all remediated and verified.

**TLS:** terminate HTTPS at Infinity Edge or a load balancer; set `issuer = https://…` so cookies become `Secure`.

## 🏗️ Architecture

A Cargo workspace of focused crates:

```
infinity-id/
├─ crates/
│  ├─ infinity-core     # security primitives: Argon2id, RSA/JWKS, JWT, TOTP, RBAC
│  ├─ infinity-server   # the IdP: OIDC/OAuth2, admin API, embedded dashboard  → bin: infinity-id
│  └─ infinity-edge     # auth-aware reverse proxy / API gateway               → bin: infinity-edge
├─ migrations/          # SQLite schema (embedded at compile time)
└─ Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, Config.toml.example, Edge.toml.example
```

- **Storage:** SQLite via `sqlx` by default (zero-dependency, local). Postgres-friendly schema.
- **HTTP:** `axum` / `tower` / `hyper`.
- **Dashboard:** static SPA embedded with `rust-embed` — served by the same binary.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Run locally (Rust)

```bash
cd infinity-id
# optional: cp Config.toml.example Config.toml   (or use env vars)
INFINITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD='ChooseAStrongOne#2025' cargo run --bin infinity-id
```

Open **http://localhost:8080** and sign in with `admin@infinity.local` and your password.
(If you don't set a password, one is generated and printed to the logs on first run.)

### Run with Docker

```bash
cd infinity-id
INFINITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD='ChooseAStrongOne#2025' docker compose up --build
# Infinity ID  → http://localhost:8080
# Infinity Edge → http://localhost:9000
```

### Verify

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/.well-known/openid-configuration
curl http://localhost:8080/.well-known/jwks.json
```

## 🛡️ Infinity Edge (API gateway)

A companion binary that fronts your services and enforces auth at the edge using Infinity ID's JWKS.

- Validates access tokens (RS256, `typ=access` only), enforces per-route scopes/roles
- Sliding per-IP rate limiting
- Injects a verified `X-Infinity-Sub` header for upstreams (and strips any spoofed one)

```bash
cp Edge.toml.example Edge.toml   # declare your routes/upstreams
cargo run --bin infinity-edge
```

```toml
[[routes]]
prefix = "/api"
upstream = "http://127.0.0.1:8081"
require_auth = true
required_scope = "api:access"   # matched against token scopes only
# required_role = "admin"       # optional: matched against token roles only
# audience = "api.example.com"  # optional: reject tokens minted for another client
```
